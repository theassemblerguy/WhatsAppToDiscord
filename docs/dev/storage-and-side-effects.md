# Storage And Side Effects

## Persistence contract

Persisted app/auth state lives under `storage/wa2dc.sqlite` (embedded SQLite).
Do not make breaking format changes casually; preserve upgrade compatibility.

Startup automatically migrates legacy files (`storage/settings`, `storage/chats`, `storage/contacts`, `storage/lastMessages`, `storage/lastTimestamp`, `storage/baileys/*`) into SQLite and moves originals into `storage/legacy-backup-<timestamp>/`.

Settings defaults come from `src/state.js`, while persisted values are loaded/merged by `src/storage.js`.
Optional encryption-at-rest is enabled by `WA2DC_DB_PASSPHRASE`; passphrase handling is implemented in `src/persistence/sqliteStore.js`.

## Runtime artifacts

The app creates/uses these files in the working directory:

- `storage/`: persistent bridge/auth state
- `downloads/`: optional local media download destination
- `logs.txt`: structured logs (pino)
- `terminal.log`: worker stdout/stderr tee from runner
- `crash-report.txt`: queued crash report when control channel is unavailable
- `restart.flag`: restart-now signal consumed by `src/runner.js`

If behavior around these files changes, document it here and in user-facing docs when applicable.

## File permission policy

`src/storage.js` enforces restrictive permissions and this must remain true:

- Directories: `0700`
- Files: `0600`

Never loosen these defaults.

Docker note: the official image entrypoint may normalize ownership of mounted `storage/` to `node:node` before startup, then run the app as `node`. This is a container-start side effect and is intended to preserve write access after upgrades from older root-running images.

## Secret hygiene

Never commit or expose:

- `.env` secrets
- Discord tokens
- WhatsApp auth/session blobs
- persisted storage payloads containing private message data
