WhatsAppToDiscord (WA2DC) is a self-hosted bridge that mirrors WhatsApp chats into Discord using WhatsApp Web (via [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)) and a Discord bot (via [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)).

Originally created by [Fatih Kilic](https://github.com/FKLC), the project is now maintained by [arespawn](https://github.com/arespawn) with the blessing of the previous author.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or higher

## Highlights

- Mirrors messages, media, reactions, and edits between WhatsApp and Discord
- Lets you whitelist which chats appear in Discord
- Bridges WhatsApp polls into Discord (creation and live updates; voting stays in WhatsApp due to API limits)
- Self-hosted: runs on your own machine/server

## Security notes

- WA2DC intentionally relies on Discord permissions for access control. Keep the control channel private and restrict who can use bot commands using Discord role/channel permissions.

## Persistence

- WA2DC stores app state and WhatsApp auth keys in `storage/wa2dc.sqlite` (embedded SQLite, no external database service required).
- On first boot after upgrade, legacy file-based data is migrated automatically from `storage/settings`, `storage/chats`, `storage/contacts`, `storage/lastMessages`, `storage/lastTimestamp`, and `storage/baileys/*`.
- Migrated legacy files are moved to `storage/legacy-backup-<timestamp>/`.
- Optional payload encryption-at-rest is available through `WA2DC_DB_PASSPHRASE` (set it before first DB creation).
- If the DB is encrypted and `WA2DC_DB_PASSPHRASE` is missing or wrong, WA2DC exits during startup instead of running with invalid auth state.
